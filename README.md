## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator pitch
Have you ever been to a restaurant and thought "I've been here before, but I don't remember what I got... Darn, it was really good too." Food Joint Journal will allow you to record the foods you love (and hate), in order to help you remember the good menu items and try new items as well. Connect with your friends and see their preferences, or rank your own joints from worst to best.
